# Java Tic-Tac-Toe Game with OOP Concepts

Welcome to the "Java Tic-Tac-Toe Game with OOP Concepts" repository! This project is designed to help you learn and showcase Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles through the implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java.

## Key Features

- **Object-Oriented Design:** This project emphasizes the use of OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to create a well-structured and modular codebase. The game logic is organized into classes and objects, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

- **Gameplay:** Experience a fully functional Tic-Tac-Toe game with a user-friendly interface. Players can take turns to make moves, and the game checks for win conditions or a draw, demonstrating the power of OOP in modeling real-world scenarios.

- **Documentation:** Clear and concise documentation is provided to explain the project's structure, classes, and methods. This documentation serves as a valuable resource for you to understand the codebase.

- **Comments and Code Style:** The code is well-commented and follows industry-standard Java coding conventions, making it easy for you to read and understand.

- **Learning Resource:** Whether you're new to OOP or want to reinforce your knowledge, this repository serves as a practical learning resource. You can study the code, modify it, and experiment with different OOP concepts.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Compile and run the Java code to start the Tic-Tac-Toe game.

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

4. Explore the codebase and documentation to learn about OOP concepts used in the project.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for improving the game, enhancing the OOP design, or adding new features, feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit a pull request. This project aims to foster a collaborative learning environment.
